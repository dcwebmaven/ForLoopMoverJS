# ForLoopMoverJS
This project causes an element to move dynamically from the upper left-hand corner of the screen to the lower right-hand corner.

Objective:
Use a for loop to move an element diagonally from the upper left corner of your webpage to the bottom right corner. Don't worry about showing the element moving, unless of course you're up for a bit of a challenge.Â
